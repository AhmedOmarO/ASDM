## Swap the axis for the homeruns plot
###If you use plotly, coord_flip() is not supported.
###Instead, swap the variables manually in aes() before calling ggplotly().

## Geoms
## https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/reference/#section-layer-geoms
# There are two types of geoms:
# geoms which perform a transformation of the data beforehand, such as geom_density_2d() which calculates contour lines from x and y positions.
# geoms which do not transform data beforehand, but use the aesthetic mapping directly, such as geom_point().


# Histogram
#Use geom_histogram() to create a histogram of the grades of the students in the gg_students dataset.

  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1) +

  geom_density(fill = "light seagreen", alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_rug(color = "blue", size = 1) +

# 9. Increase the data to ink ratio by removing the y axis label, setting the theme to theme_minimal(), and removing the border of the density polygon.

# Faceting
# 13. Create a data frame called baseball based on the Hitters dataset.
# In this data frame, create a factor variable which splits playersâ€™ salary range into 3 categories. 
#Tip: use the filter() function to remove the missing values, and then use the cut() function and assign nice labels to the categories. 
#In addition, create a variable which indicates the proportion of career hits that was a home run.

    Career_hmrun_proportion = CHmRun/CHits
  )

# 14. Create a scatter plot where you map CWalks to the x position and the proportion you calculated in the previous exercise to the y position.
# Fix the y axis limits to (0, 0.4) and the x axis to (0, 1600) using ylim() and xlim(). Add nice x and y axis titles using the labs() function. Save the plot as the variable baseball_plot.
